Python Conferences and SIGs
===========================

* 1998-11 7th International Python Conference
  * From Jon Riehl's [notes](https://wildideas.org/basil/):
  > Last year (IPC7,) I thought I was going to surprise the Python community
  > by presenting a prototype Python to C translator. Little did I know,
  > I was only one of three people who announced such a product.
 * These apparently were:
   * "Converting Python Virtual Machine Code to C", John Aycock
   * "PyFront: Conversion of Python to C Extension Modules", Jon Riehl
   * (3rd - ???)
* 2000-01 8th International Python Conference
  * From Jon Riehl's [notes](https://wildideas.org/basil/):
  > This year (IPC8,) in the interest of keeping people up to date,
  > there was a two hour session that hosted the developers of these
  > prototypes. The only system left standing is now complete and under
  > beta test. Bill Tutt and Greg Stein cowrote Python2C, which they
  > have been continuing to work on at (http://www.mudlib.org/~rassilon/p2c/).
  > The other player is John Aycock. John declared he would look into run time
  > type instrumentation, which I think should end up forming some sort of a
  > JIT for Python. He lives at: (http://gulf.uvic.ca/~aycock/) 
* 2000 [Compiler-SIG](ftp://ftp.ntua.gr/mirror/python/sigs/compiler-sig/index.html)
  * "This SIG grew out of a Developers' Day session at the 8th International Python
    Conference. Ka-Ping Yee took
    [notes on the session](ftp://ftp.ntua.gr/mirror/python/sigs/compiler-sig/dev-day-notes.txt)."
* 2016-07-11 [Python Compilers Workshop](https://python-compilers-workshop.github.io/)
  at SciPy 2016 conference.

of the Python language and querying ASTs for language-level properties that
are specified as sets of features.
